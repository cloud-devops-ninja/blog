Hello Rubyists 👋🧑‍🎨,

Take two. Welcome to the summer edition of the Amsterdam Ruby meetup! Let's talk about hosting and how our hobby projects are going.

We are doing this live at WeTravel in Amsterdam. WeTravel will not just host our event, they will also provide us with food 🥦 and drinks 🧃. We have added an attendee limit this time. We may change this before the event itself, so keep an eye on this space if you don't secure a spot right away!

It goes without saying that we have a great set of speakers again. Our first guest is the marvelous, Esther Barthel who will talk to us about using your dev skils to transition Ops to the Cloud.

Our second guest is the astonishing Aidan Rudkovskyi who will talk about his NotForSale project.

This location is completely (wheelchair) accessible. Don't feel like joining in person? The live stream can be found on YouTube, and it will stay up after the event. See you there! Can't wait ✨ 🌈

Floor, Arno, Tom, Rayta
