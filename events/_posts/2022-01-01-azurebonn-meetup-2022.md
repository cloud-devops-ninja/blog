Transitioning Ops to the Cloud, adding Dev skills to the mix
This session offers tips and tricks to add core Developer skills to your skillset, so you can transition from (on-premises) Operations to a Cloud DevOps role. This session will zoom in on some basic knowledge and terminology that will make it easier to understand the shift in work and competences for DevOps engineers.

Keep in mind that this session is not a technical deep dive that helps you pick the right tool for the job at hand, but it focuses on some basic knowledge of DevOps processes that will help you to plan the next steps in your career and pick those DevOps competences that will put the fun back into your work.

We plan this meetup again as in-person event and will bring futher information in January.
